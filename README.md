# VoltaML_Assignment

Here in this assignment the dataset contains a modified version of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000 which only contains the classes nv, bkl, mel( around 550 images each).

1) nv - Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants, which all are included in our series. The variants may differ              significantly from a dermatoscopic point of view.

2) bkl - "Benign keratosis" is a generic class that includes seborrheic ker- atoses ("senile wart"), solar lentigo - which can be regarded a flat variant of seborrheic     keratosis - and lichen-planus like keratoses (LPLK), which corresponds to a seborrheic keratosis or a solar lentigo with inflammation and regression. The three           subgroups may look different dermatoscop- ically, but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic term       histopathologically. From a dermatoscopic view, lichen planus-like keratoses are especially challeng- ing because they can show morphologic features mimicking melanoma   and are often biopsied or excised for diagnostic reasons.

3) mel - Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical   excision. Melanomas can be invasive or non-invasive (in situ). We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ, but did exclude non-pigmented,           subungual, ocular or mucosal melanoma.
